I'm a ph.D student in [Industrial & System Engineering](https://statistics.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/) in [Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (DSAIL)](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/) lab.

My research interests lie in realm of **applied machine learning**, particularly in harnessing the relationships between data by leveraging the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Currently, my primary focus involves the application of maching learning to the filed of **Bioinformatics**, with a specific emphasis on aiding the analysis on **Single-cell RNA sequencing data**
